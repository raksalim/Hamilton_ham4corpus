# For example:

Using [St√©fan Sinclair](https://github.com/sgsinclair) and [Geoffrey Rockwell](https://github.com/GeoffreyRockwell)'s [Voyant Tools](http://voyant-tools.org) to explore the text of the musical, I discovered the following about the Hamilton lyrics en masse (in order as one text block, with no names of speakers/singers interspersed):

  * 21,351 total words and 2,939 unique word forms
  * Interesting frequent words: da (103 times, thanks George III), time (87), hamilton appears the same number of times wait does (79), room (71), burr (69), sir (56), satisfied (37), story (35), helpless (32).
  * Unsurprisingly, "sir" is the most frequent one-away collocate of "burr" (9 times).
  * Single word occurrence via microsearch (map of where a given word appears throughout the lyrics):

![Screenshot of Voyant microsearch for occurences of the word "wait" throughout the Hamilton lyrics](https://github.com/amandavisconti/ham4corpus/blob/master/wait_occurrences.png)
Red = the word "wait" vs the rest of the lyrics (the second-to-last red block is Burr's final "Wait!", last one is Eliza's "I can't wait to see you again")

![Screenshot of Voyant microsearch for occurences of the word "Hamilton" throughout the Hamilton lyrics](https://github.com/amandavisconti/ham4corpus/blob/master/hamilton_occurrences.png)
Red = the word "Hamilton" vs the rest of the lyrics (was surprised that the word "Hamilton" isn't used again after Burr's last "The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me")

# How

I wish I could say my Python is non-rusty enough that I scraped Genius.com and Wikipedia to get this data, but it isn't and I was on hold on the phone, so I just cut and pasted everything into a text document and grepped:

^\s*?\r to remove blank lines

\[.* to remove the [character names]
